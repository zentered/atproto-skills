# ATProto OAuth

ATProto uses OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with three mandatory extensions: **PAR** (Pushed Authorization Requests), **DPoP** (Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession), and **PKCE** (S256 only). There is no client registration — clients publish metadata at a URL, and that URL *is* the `client_id`.

Generic OAuth libraries will not work. Mandatory DPoP, PAR, decentralized discovery, and metadata-as-registration require custom implementation.

## Prerequisites

Identity resolution (handle → DID → PDS → auth server) is covered by the **atproto-domain** skill. This skill starts after the auth server has been discovered.

## The Flow

```
[Identity Resolution → Auth Server Discovery] → PKCE → DPoP → PAR → User Auth → Callback → Token Exchange → Resource Requests
 ↑ See atproto-domain skill
```

### 1. PKCE

- Generate code verifier: 32 random bytes, base64url-encoded (unpadded)
- S256 challenge: SHA-256 hash of verifier, base64url-encoded (unpadded)
- S256 is the **only** supported challenge method

### 2. DPoP Key Pair

Generate a fresh ES256 (P-256 ECDSA) key pair per session. This binds tokens to the client instance.

**DPoP proof JWT structure:**
```
Header: { typ: "dpop+jwt", alg: "ES256", jwk: { kty, crv, x, y } }
Payload: { jti: <uuid>, htm: <HTTP method>, htu: <URL>, iat: <timestamp> }
```

- `typ` MUST be lowercase `dpop+jwt` (not `DPoP+jwt`)
- `htu` MUST exclude query string and fragment — scheme + authority + path only
- Add `nonce` when the server provides one via `DPoP-Nonce` header
- Add `ath` (base64url SHA-256 of access token) when making resource requests

### 3. Pushed Authorization Request (PAR)

POST to the PAR endpoint with all auth parameters in the body.

**The nonce dance:** The first PAR request will typically return HTTP 400 with a `DPoP-Nonce` header. This is expected — extract the nonce, rebuild the DPoP proof with it, and retry. This is not an error condition.

**Required body parameters:**
- `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `response_type` ("code"), `scope`, `state`
- `code_challenge`, `code_challenge_method` ("S256")
- `client_assertion_type` ("urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer")
- `client_assertion` (signed JWT — confidential clients only)
- `login_hint` (optional but recommended — the user's DID)

**Headers:** `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `DPoP: <proof>`

**Critical:** Always call `.toString()` on `URLSearchParams` when passing as `fetch()` body — some runtimes (notably Cloudflare Workers) don't serialize correctly otherwise.

### 4. User Authorization

Redirect the browser to:
```
{authorization_endpoint}?request_uri={from_PAR}&client_id={client_id}
```

### 5. Callback Verification

The callback returns `code`, `state`, and `iss` parameters. Verify:
- `state` matches the stored value (CSRF protection)
- `iss` matches the expected authorization server (prevents mix-up attacks)

### 6. Token Exchange

POST to token endpoint with `grant_type=authorization_code`, the auth code, `redirect_uri`, `code_verifier`, `client_id`, and client assertion. Include DPoP proof header. Handle nonce retry (same pattern as PAR).

**After receiving tokens, verify `sub`** — the DID in the token response MUST match the DID resolved during identity resolution. This prevents authorization-to-wrong-account attacks.

### 7. Resource Requests

```
Authorization: DPoP <access_token>
DPoP: <proof with ath claim>
```

The `ath` claim is the base64url-encoded SHA-256 hash of the access token. Handle 401 with `DPoP-Nonce` header by retrying with the nonce.

## Token Lifetimes

| Client Type | Access Token | Refresh Token | Overall Session |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public | ≤30 min | ~2 weeks | ~2 weeks |
| Confidential | ≤30 min | ~3 months | ~2 years |

Refresh tokens are **single-use** — each refresh returns a new refresh token. Implement locking to prevent concurrent refresh requests, which would invalidate the session.

## Development & Testing

- **No sandbox exists.** Test against live `bsky.social`.
- **Localhost exception:** Auth servers support `http://localhost` as a `client_id` origin for development.
- **ngrok:** For HTTPS development, tunnel the local server and use the ngrok URL as `PUBLIC_URL` / `client_id`.
- The auth server must be able to reach the client metadata URL — local-only deployments won't work for the PAR step.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Base64url padding** — The bsky.social server validates JWTs with a Zod schema (`signedJwtSchema`) that only allows base64url chars (`A-Za-z0-9-_`) and dots. If the base64url encoder adds `=` padding, the JWT silently fails Zod validation, the credential union falls through to the `none` type, and the server returns a misleading `"required a client_assertion"` error. **Always use unpadded base64url encoding.** For `@oslojs/encoding`, use `encodeBase64urlNoPadding`, not `encodeBase64url`. This applies to JWT headers, payloads, signatures, PKCE code verifiers, and SHA-256 hashes.
2. **Misleading server errors** — The bsky.social server parses client credentials as a Zod discriminated union (`jwtBearer | secretPost | none`). If the `client_assertion` is present but malformed (padding, wrong format), Zod silently falls through to the `none` schema which strips `client_assertion` entirely. The server then reports "required a client_assertion" when the real issue is JWT format validation failure. Debug by checking the JWT string itself, not the request body.
3. **Body serialization** — `URLSearchParams` passed directly as `fetch()` body may not serialize in all runtimes. Always use `.toString()`.
4. **DPoP `htu` includes query params** — strip them. `htu` is scheme + host + path only. The server validates this with a Zod schema that explicitly rejects query strings and fragments.
5. **Client assertion `aud` wrong** — must be the **authorization server identifier** (the issuer URL, e.g. `https://bsky.social`), NOT the endpoint URL. The server validates `aud` against `authorizationServerIdentifier` from its config. This is different from many OAuth implementations that expect the token endpoint URL.
6. **DPoP `typ` casing** — must be lowercase `dpop+jwt`.
7. **Missing `iss` verification** on callback — required to prevent mix-up attacks.
8. **Missing `sub` verification** after token exchange — required to prevent account confusion.
9. **DPoP nonce retry must allow multiple attempts** — The first PAR/token request returns 400 with a `DPoP-Nonce` header. This is expected. But a single retry is not enough — the server may return a *new* nonce on the retry if the first one became stale during processing. Use a retry counter (max 2) instead of a boolean guard. The error message for this is `use_dpop_nonce` with description "nonce mismatch".
10. **`login_hint` should be the handle, not the DID** — Pass the user's handle (e.g. `patrickheneise.com`) as `login_hint` in the PAR request so the auth server pre-fills the identifier field. Using the DID shows `@did:plc:...` which password managers won't recognize.
11. **Client metadata unreachable** — if the auth server can't fetch the `client_id` URL, the entire flow fails silently.
12. **Missing COOKIE_SECRET** — session cookies require an HMAC signing key. Without it, post-OAuth session creation fails even if the OAuth flow itself succeeds.
